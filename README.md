This is a shell file that allows the creation of a new repository on github via a curl command. I have also added the implementation of the creation of a local repository under the same name in the desktop. An access token is needed which can be generated here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new   
Provide a description and selected the desired scopes needed by the token.
